# Bun Frameworks

The accompanying code for my [ðŸ§„ Bun Frameworks](https://bobalazek.com/blog/0004-bun-frameworks) post on my blog.

## Installation

* Clone the repository
* Run `bun install` to install the dependencies
* Run `bun run ./benchmark.js` to run the benchmark

## Results

The results are in the blog post, but here they are for reference:

## Notes

I also tried `hyper-express`, but that does not seem to be compatible with Bun. At least not at the time of doing this benchmark.
